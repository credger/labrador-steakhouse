                        <p id = 'aboutParagraph'>Labrador Steakhouse is first-rate steakhouse dedicated to offering perfectly cooked
                        steak and a great atmosphere.  We serve 100% grass-fed beef sourced from local farms.
                        Our drink offerings include over 20 beers on tap, an extensive cocktail
                        menu, and wines from some of the best vinyards around the world.

                        We spent months working with interior designers to craft the perfect feel for our steakhouse.
                        Inspired by modern mountain cabin architecture, our dining space features an ensemble of
                        beautiful timber beams, decorative stone, and elaborate fireplaces.  We hope you enjoy your
                        dining experience as much as we did creating it!</p>
